//The Open/Closed Principle (OCP) is one of the SOLID principles of object-oriented design, introduced by Bertrand Meyer.
// It states that software entities (such as classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
// In other words, once a module is developed and stable,
// its behavior should be extendable without requiring changes to its source code.
